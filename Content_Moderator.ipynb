    "#  Textual Content Moderation using Cognitive Services and Python\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** This notebook will not run properly on the Microsoft Azure Notebooks platform because their virtual machines use an older version of OpenSSL that is not comaptible with Microsoft's Azure Cognitive Services APIs. ***You will therefore need to run this notebook in Google Colab***.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab assignment, we will be using one of the **Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services** to build a system that can automatically detect inappropriate content such as profanity, hate speech, threats, racism, etc. in written text. Recall that **cognitive computing** involves using artificial intelligence technologies to build systems that can perform tasks which could previously only be accomplished by the human mind. The detection of inappropriate content in written text is an excellent example of such a task, and as such we will building a **cognitive computing system** in this lab assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the time you have completed this lab, you will have achieved all of the following learning objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand what Azure Cognitive Services are.\n",
    "* Have the ability to configure and provision cognitive services as resources on the Microsoft Azure platform.\n",
    "* Understand the purpose of an application programming interface (API).\n",
    "* Use Python to connect to and interact with the Content Moderator cognitive service via its API.\n",
    "* Have the ability to iteratively send written comments to the Content Moderator cognitive service, and process the results to determine if the written comments are inappropriate or obscene.\n",
    "* Analyze the results obtained from the Content Moderator cognitive service, and compare the performance of those results to labels assigned by human judges.\n",
    "* Continue to develop skills working with and analyzing data in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About Azure Cognitive Services\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Microsoft:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Cognitive Services bring AI within reach of every developer... All it takes is an API call to embed the ability to see, hear, speak, search, understand, and accelerate decision-making into your apps.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft currently has **nearly 30 cognitive service APIs** available that can perform a wide variety of tasks. We will be using several of these APIs in our remaining lab assignments, and you will also need to use at least one of these APIs in your final project.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may learn more about Azure Cognitive Services [on this website](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services).\n",
    "\n",
    "## About the Content Moderator Cognitive Service\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Microsoft:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Azure Content Moderator is a cognitive service that checks text, image, and video content for material that is potentially offensive, risky, or otherwise undesirable. When this material is found, the service applies appropriate labels (flags) to the content. Your app can then handle flagged content in order to comply with regulations or maintain the intended environment for users.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The Content Moderator service is hence intended to provide developers with an all-in-one solution to content moderation tasks. If you consider the Web in its entirety, you will notice that a great deal of content is **user generated**. For example, virtually all of the content on websites such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Stack Overflow, Wikipedia, etc. is created by users, and not by the companies that operate those websites. In order to provide a positive experience for as many users as possible, companies are highly interested in ensuring that potentially offensive content is not contained in the videos, images, or written text that users post on the companies' websites. The purpose of the Content Moderator service, then, is to provide a single API that can be used to detect inappropriate content in text, images, or video. We will be using only the text moderation part of the API in this lab assignment, but I wanted you to be aware of the API's image and video moderation services, as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may learn more about the Content Moderator service [on this website](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/content-moderator).\n",
    "\n",
    "## About APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "An API (Application Programming Interface) is an interface that allows the resources, capabilities, or services of one computer system to be used by other computer systems. As with functions in computer programs, using an API typically involves passing one or more inputs to the system that provides the API, which then returns one or more outputs back to the system that called the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about APIs, please read [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lab Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this, you will need to complete the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Create or sign into a Microsoft Azure account. If you do not already have an Azure account, then please sign up for a free student account [on this website](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students).\n",
    "*   Add the \"Content Moderator\" resource to your Azure account. To do this, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. After signing into your Azure account, use the search box to search for \"Cognitive Services\".\n",
    "  2. Click the \"Add\" button.\n",
    "  3. Next to the list of cognitive services, click the \"See More\" link.\n",
    "  4. Select the \"Content Moderator\" option.\n",
    "  5. Click the \"Create\" button.\n",
    "  6. Provide a unique name for the resource. I used \"585-Content-Moderator\", but feel free to use whatever name you like.\n",
    "  7. Be sure that your \"Azure for Students\" subscription is selected, and that you have chosen a location for the resource (e.g., \"(US) West US 2\").\n",
    "  8. Choose the \"F0\" (free) pricing tier. This tier allows one call to the API per second, with a maximum of 5,000 calls per month.\n",
    "  9. Choose or create a resource group for the Content Moderator resource (e.g., \"585\").\n",
    "  10. Wait for your new resource to be deployed (this may take a minute or two).\n",
    "  11. Go to your new Content Moderator resource.\n",
    "  12. **Copy and paste your key and endpoint URL into the code cell below**. You will need these values in order to be able to make calls to the API from your Python code.\n",
    "  13. Be sure to run the code cell below before continuing with the lab assignment.\n",

In brief, if the sum of all of the current numeric columns for a given comment is greater than zero, then we know that the human judges found something to be wrong with that comment (i.e., the comment is *inappropriate*). Otherwise, if the sum is equal to zero, then we know that the human judges found nothing wrong with the comment (i.e., the comment is *appropriate*).\n",

The first line of code simply computes the sum of all of the existing numeric columns in the dataframe for each comment, and stores the results in a new column named `human_inappropriate`. If the sum of the columns for a particular comment is greater than or equal to one, then it indicates that the comment is *inappropriate* in some way. What we want, however, is for a value of \"1\" in our new column to indicate that the comment is *inappropriate*, while a value of \"0\" should indicate that the comment is *appropriate*. As such, the second line of code in the cell below recodes the results of our \"sum\" operation, such that inappropriate comments will labeled with a \"1\" and appropriate comments will be labeled with a \"0\". This second line of code uses a very useful feature of Python called *list comprehension*.

Microsoft's engineers have promised that they will improve this in the next release, but for now we'll just need to work around this issue. The results that are returned by the API are also quite complex. For example, they include an automatically corrected version of the input text, extensive details about any personally identifiable information (PII) that the API detected, the location of each inappropriate term in the input text, etc.\n",

    "In light of the above considerations, and given that this is our first time working with a Cognitive Services API, I have created a `get_inappropriate_terms()` function for this assignment that should make working with the API much easier. In brief, we will simply need to pass in a comment (as a string variable) to the function. It will then call the API, and return any inappropriate terms as a list.\n",
